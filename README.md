# Project: Client-Side Secure File Encryptor/Decryptor

## Description

This project is a fully client-side tool for encrypting and decrypting files using strong, modern cryptographic standards. The entire process happens locally in the user's web browser, meaning **no files are ever uploaded to a server**, ensuring complete privacy.

The tool allows a user to select a file, provide a password, and generate a securely encrypted version of that file for safe storage or transmission. It can then decrypt the file back to its original state ONLY using the password that was provided while encrypting.

This project demonstrates a crucial aspect of software data security: **cryptography and data protection**.

### Security Concepts Demonstrated

* **Client-Side Encryption:** All cryptographic operations are performed on the user's machine, using the built-in and secure **Web Crypto API** (`SubtleCrypto`). This provides a high level of privacy.
* **AES-GCM Authenticated Encryption:** The tool uses AES-GCM, a modern and highly secure symmetric encryption algorithm. The "GCM" (Galois/Counter Mode) part is critical as it provides **authenticated encryption**, which not only ensures confidentiality (secrecy) but also **integrity and authenticity**, protecting the data against tampering.
* **PBKDF2 Key Derivation:** User passwords are not used directly as encryption keys. Instead, the tool uses the **PBKDF2** (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) algorithm. This function takes a low-entropy password and "stretches" it through thousands of rounds of hashing to produce a strong, high-entropy cryptographic key, making it resistant to brute-force attacks.
* **Cryptographically Secure Randomness:** The initialization vector (IV) and the salt for PBKDF2 are generated using `crypto.getRandomValues()`, which is a cryptographically secure random number generator provided by the browser.

## How to Run

1.  **Download the `Tool.html` file.**
2.  **Open the `Tool.html` file in any modern web browser** 

## How to Use the Demo

**To Encrypt a File:**
1.  Click "Choose File" and select any file from your computer (or download and use the demo.txt file provided in the repositery).
2.  Enter a password in the password field.
3.  Click the "Encrypt" button.
4.  After a moment, a download link will appear. Click it to save the encrypted file (it will be named `[original_name].encrypted`).

**To Decrypt a File:**
1.  Click "Choose File" and select a file that you previously encrypted with this tool.
2.  Enter the **exact same password** you used to encrypt it.
3.  Click the "Decrypt" button.
4.  A download link will appear. Click it to save the original, decrypted file.


##  Future Improvements

This tool provides a strong baseline for client-side encryption. Here are several advanced features that could be added to enhance its security and functionality:

* **Password Strength Meter:** Integrate a real-time password strength checker to visually guide users toward creating stronger, more brute-force-resistant passwords.

* **WebAssembly (WASM) for Performance:** For encrypting very large files (over 1 GB), JavaScript can be slow. The core cryptographic functions could be rewritten in a high-performance language like Rust, compiled to WebAssembly, and executed in the browser for near-native speed.

* **Streaming API Integration:** Currently, the entire file is loaded into memory, which can crash the browser with large files. By using the File System Access API with streams, the tool could encrypt and decrypt files of any size by processing them in manageable chunks.

* **Public Key (Asymmetric) Cryptography:** Implement an "Encrypt for Someone Else" mode using RSA or ECIES. A user could paste in a recipient's public key to encrypt a file, and only the recipient who holds the corresponding private key would be able to decrypt it. This removes the need to securely share a password.
