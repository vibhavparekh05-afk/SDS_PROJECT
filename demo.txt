This is a sample document for testing the Secure File Encryptor.

If you can read this, the file is in its original, decrypted state.

Use the tool (index.html) to encrypt this file with a password. After encryption, you will download a file named "test-document.txt.encrypted". This new file should contain garbled, unreadable text.

Then, use the tool again to decrypt "test-document.txt.encrypted" with the same password. The result should be this original document, perfectly restored.

This process demonstrates that the encryption and decryption cycle works correctly.
