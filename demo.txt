This is a sample document for testing the Secure File Encryptor.

If you can read this, the file is in its original, decrypted state.

Use the tool (Tool.html) to encrypt this file with a password. After encryption, you will download a file named "demo.txt.encrypted". This new file should contain encrypted, unreadable text.

Then, use the tool again to decrypt "demo.txt.encrypted" with the same password. The result should be this original document.
